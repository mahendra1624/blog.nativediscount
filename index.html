              <p class="text-lg font-bold leading-7 tracking-normal">While some people spend up to $100 to subscribes in all come out TV subscription and streaming platforms, a little genius has found a way that allow everyone to legally access all the channels from our TVs (regardless of the TV model and year).</p>
              <p class="text-md mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">We had the chance to interview him exclusively at Techno Mag when he returned from Silicon Valley.<u> In this article you'll find out how to access all the TV channels, no matter how old your TV is.</u></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-normal">Who is Rémy, the Swiss genius who invented a box capable of unlocking access to all TV channels?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <p class="text-md mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">Rémy is the kind of guy like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates or Elon Musk. Graduating as an engineer two years ahead of his classmates, he leaves early in 2020 for Silicon Valley to create the next startup that will revolutionize his industry.</p>
              <p class="text-md mt-6 leading-7 tracking-normal">Once there, he quickly teamed up with two other talented engineers and set out to invent a modern and conected television for less than $100. But soon enough, the young team realised that the project was doomed to failure: the price of electronic parts making it impossible for the project to be economically viable.</p>
              <p class="text-md mt-6 leading-7 tracking-normal">After this failure, Rémy went back to the drawing board and came up with <strong> an idea that will revolution the entertainment industry </strong> - a box that can be plugged into any TV and give users access to all TV channels and video-on-demand platforms. Offering a seamless viewing experience and eliminates the need for multiple subscriptions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-4">
              <img src="./img/f-banner-2.png" alt="Content Image" class="w-full h-auto">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <p class="text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal">Three months later, it's a real hit. First in Nevada, then in Texas and finally in Arizona, this magic box is the talk of the town, allowing thousands of households to access all the television channels<strong><u> without having to pay exorbitant monthly subscriptions.</u></strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-normal">What is this box that gives you instant access to all channels and streaming services?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <p class="text-md mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">This is what the Smart TV box looks like. It's a small box that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV. The advantage is that <strong>all TVs around the world have been equipped with an HDMI port since 2003, so almost anyone can use it.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-4 flex justify-center">
              <img src="./img/side-img.jpg" alt="Content Image" class="w-96 h-auto">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <p class="text-lg mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">Once plugged in, the box will act as a satellite and allow the TV to access all the channels and streaming applications (including the most prestigious ones).</p>
              <p class="text-lg mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">Their real stroke of genius in making all this possible was the idea of buying thousands of accesses to channels and applications and then redistributing them to the boxes thanks to artificial intelligence.<strong> The AI they have developed allows all the TVs connected to the box to choose and watch any programme without waiting or interruption.</strong></p>
              <p class="text-lg mt-4 leading-7 tracking-normal">In this way, everyone is included. Individuals can access all programmes for a fraction of the initial price, Smart TV makes a profit by selling the boxes and the programme providers still get thousands of new orders.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6">
              <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-normal">How does it work?</h2>
              <p class="text-md mt-6 leading-7 tracking-normal">Just as you plug a USB stick into your computer, here you simply plug the box into the HDMI port of your TV to <strong><u>automatically gain access to all the programmes you ever dreamed of watching.</u></strong></p>
              <img src="./img/f-banner-3.jpg" alt="Content Image" class="w-full h-auto mb-4">
              <p class="mt-8 text-md eading-7 tracking-normal "><u>It is very easy to set up:</u></p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-6 leading-10 text-xl">
                <li>Find the HDMI port on the TV (usually on the back or side).</li>
                <li>Plug in the Smart TV box.</li>
                <li>Wait for the light to come on.</li>
                <li>Turn on the TV and <strong>enjoy instant access to channels and apps.</strong></li>
              </ol>
              <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">If you want to change TVs or install the box on another TV, just unplug it and plug it back into the TV you want. It's that easy.</p>
              <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">The best part is that the device has a minimum life span of 10 years and as it is connected to the network,<u> access to new channels and applications is updated in real time.</u></p>
              <p class="py-6"> PS: <em>A detailed user manual is included with the product</em></p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why is the Smart TV revolutionizing the world of television?</h2>
              <img src="./img/f-banner-4.jpg" alt="Content Image" class="w-full h-auto mb-4">
              <p class="py-4 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">In every industry, a revolution happens. Amazon has gradually replaced bookshops, music streaming has replaced CDs, etc..</p>
              <p class="py-4 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">Today, it is the world of television that is evolving and it will no longer be able to be satisfied with offering very expensive private channels with the arrival of the Smart TV box.</p>
              <p class="py-4 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">Some even say that this company could be <strong>valued at more than one billion dollars</strong> within three years, so promising is it.</p>
              <p class="py-4 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal ">The geek community is therefore very excited to see this product arrive in the UK and it is easy to see why. For those of you who haven't quite figured out what the Smart TV box can do, we've put together a little recap for you:</p>

              <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal">As mentioned above, the box simply acts as a relay for access to channels, applications, internet, etc. <u> It is not a pirate access.</u> If it were not legal, the company would not be allowed to market its box anyway.</p>
              <p class="py-6 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal"><strong>The box is therefore 100% legal and without any risk.</strong>  You have every right to buy it.

              <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7 tracking-normal">The company has announced a retail price of $99 for its Smart TV box. A price that may seem expensive at first, but which is very interesting in the long term,<strong>because it is not a subscription to pay every month.</strong>Especially since new channels and applications are constantly being updated.</p>
